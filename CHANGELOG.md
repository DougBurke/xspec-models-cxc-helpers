# Changes in xspec-models-cxc-helpers

## 0.1.0

Changed from installing into the xpsec-models-cxc namespace
package - so accessing the routines via xspec_models_cxc.utils - to
its own pacgage: xspec_models_cxc_templates. This is a bit annoying,
but we want xspec_models_cxc to be useable, which the previous
approach prevented.

## 0.0.1

Initial version. This uses code from xspec-models-cxc 0.0.31.
